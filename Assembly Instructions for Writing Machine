Assembly Instructions
Overview
The assembly of the Writing Machine involves mounting the X-axis motor housing onto a board, followed by mounting the Y-axis motor housing onto the X-axis lead screw. Finally, the solenoid mount/housing is mounted onto the Y-axis lead screw. This setup is similar to a CNC machine, where each axis moves independently to control the writing implement.

Step-by-Step Assembly
Step 1: Prepare the Board
Select a Sturdy Board:

Choose a board that is large enough to accommodate the X-axis motor housing and thick enough to provide stability.
Mark Mounting Positions:

Using a pencil and ruler, mark the position on the board where the X-axis motor housing will be placed. Ensure that the position allows for smooth movement along the X axis.
Step 2: Mount the X-Axis Motor Housing
Position the X-Axis Motor Housing:

Align the X-axis motor housing with the marked position on the board.
Secure the Housing:

Using screws, attach the X-axis motor housing to the board. Make sure it is firmly secured to prevent any movement.
Install the X-Axis Motor:

Insert the stepper motor into the X-axis motor housing and secure it with screws. Ensure that the motor shaft is connected to the lead screw for smooth movement.
Step 3: Mount the Y-Axis Motor Housing
Position the Y-Axis Motor Housing:

Align the Y-axis motor housing with the X-axis lead screw. The Y-axis motor housing will be mounted onto the X-axis lead screw, allowing it to move along the X axis.
Secure the Y-Axis Housing:

Attach the Y-axis motor housing to the X-axis lead screw using appropriate fasteners. Ensure it is securely mounted to prevent any movement.
Install the Y-Axis Motor:

Insert the stepper motor into the Y-axis motor housing and secure it with screws. Ensure that the motor shaft is connected to the lead screw for smooth movement along the Y axis.
Step 4: Mount the Solenoid Housing
Position the Solenoid Mount/Housing:

Align the solenoid mount/housing with the Y-axis lead screw. The solenoid mount/housing will be mounted onto the Y-axis lead screw, allowing it to move along the Y axis.
Secure the Solenoid Housing:

Attach the solenoid mount/housing to the Y-axis lead screw using appropriate fasteners. Ensure it is securely mounted to prevent any movement.
Install the Solenoid:

Insert the solenoid into the mount/housing and secure it with screws. Ensure that the solenoid can move freely up and down.
Step 5: Connect the Components
Wiring the Motors and Solenoid:

Connect the stepper motors and solenoid to their respective drivers and the control board. Follow the wiring diagram provided in the instructions.
Power Supply:

Connect the power supply to the control board, ensuring that it provides the correct voltage and current for the motors and solenoid.
MQTT Setup:

Set up the MQTT broker using the HexTech MQTT Broker software, and configure the connection settings in the Java code.
Step 6: Testing the Assembly
Initial Test:

Power on the machine and run a test command to ensure that all components are working correctly. Check for smooth movement along the X and Y axes and proper operation of the solenoid.
Calibration:

If necessary, calibrate the motors and solenoid to ensure accurate and precise movement.
Notes
Securely Fasten All Components: Ensure that all components are securely fastened to prevent any movement during operation.
Check for Obstructions: Make sure there are no obstructions that could interfere with the movement of the motors or solenoid.
Regular Maintenance: Perform regular maintenance checks to ensure that all components are functioning correctly and to replace any worn-out parts.
By following these steps, you can assemble the Writing Machine and ensure it operates smoothly and accurately.
